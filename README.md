# Useful Codes for ML in Python

I am python ML researcher. just like every other programmer, I forget syntax a lot & then need to google each thing again. 
So i decided to write down some of codes and share with public. In case someone else wanna use these.
P.S If someone wants to contribute, you are most welcome.
